# Septiembre
A simple storefront built with React and bundled with Parceljs.

## Why Septiembre?
It's September in Spanish and it sounded hipster.

## Todo
- Support for browsers that don't support CSS Grid
- Weird bug with CSS Grid in Safari that triggers the wrong breakpoint on page load?
- Fully implement 'change' so that size, colour, and quantity can be changed in-cart
- A better empty state for the cart (e.g. with an illustration or similar)
- Full test coverage
